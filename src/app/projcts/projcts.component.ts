      <p>
        In this project, I played a key role as a Front-End Developer, contributing to the creation of a dynamic and responsive banking application for ABN AMRO.<br><br>
        The application featured role-based login functionality, which allowed admin, operations team, and engagement managers to access different user interfaces tailored to their specific roles.<br><br>
        Key front-end features I implemented include:<br><br>
        
        - <strong>Role-based Conditional Rendering</strong>: Ensured that different user roles only had access to specific UI components based on their permissions, enhancing both security and user experience.<br><br>
        - <strong>Dynamic Forms and Tables</strong>: Developed dynamic forms for data entry and interactive tables for displaying transaction data, customized based on the user's role.<br><br>
        - <strong>Graphical Data Representation</strong>: Integrated visual data representation tools (charts, graphs) to display real-time banking data for better insights and reporting.<br><br>
        - <strong>API Integration</strong>: Worked on seamless integration with various backend APIs to fetch, update, and display critical banking information.<br><br>
        - <strong>Responsive UI</strong>: Ensured the UI was responsive across devices, delivering an optimized experience for desktop and mobile users.<br><br>
        
        This project helped streamline banking operations by delivering a well-structured, role-based interface with modern, intuitive designs and real-time data capabilities.
